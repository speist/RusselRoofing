## Business Hours Considerations

For non-emergency leads, consider setting up business hours logic:

1. **Business Hours Property**
   - Create a calculated property that determines if it's business hours
   - Use this in delay actions for notifications

2. **After-Hours Handling**
   - Emergency leads: Process immediately
   - High-value leads: Delay notification until business hours
   - Standard leads: Queue for next business day

## Integration Points

### Slack Integration
- Configure Slack app in HubSpot
- Set up channels: #emergency-leads, #high-value-leads, #general-leads
- Use workflow actions to send notifications

### Email Integration
- Set up email templates for each priority level
- Configure automated sequences for follow-up
- Include CRM links for mobile access

### SMS Integration (Emergency Only)
- Configure SMS provider (Twilio, etc.)
- Emergency leads only to comply with regulations
- Include opt-out mechanisms

## Performance Monitoring

Set up reports to track:
- Response times by priority level
- Conversion rates by lead score
- Assignment distribution
- Workflow completion rates
