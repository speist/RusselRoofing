   - **Recommendation:** Remove or replace with proper logging solution

2. **Missing Test Coverage**: No automated tests implemented
   - **Impact:** High - No regression protection
   - **Recommendation:** Implement unit tests for form components

### Medium Priority Issues
1. **Commented Out Code**: Future step implementations commented out
   - **Impact:** Medium - Code maintainability
   - **Recommendation:** Remove commented code or implement TODO tracking

2. **Generic README**: Documentation not updated for project specifics
   - **Impact:** Medium - Developer onboarding
   - **Recommendation:** Update with project-specific information

3. **Git Workspace Issues**: Deleted files and workspace structure problems
   - **Impact:** Medium - Version control integrity
   - **Recommendation:** Clean up git workspace before merge
