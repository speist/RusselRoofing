## 5. HubSpot API Key Configuration

### Date: 2025-10-09

**File:** `apps/web/.env.local`

### Added HubSpot Configuration
Added the HubSpot developer API key to enable CRM integration:

```bash
# =============================================================================
# HUBSPOT CONFIGURATION
# =============================================================================
# HubSpot Private App Token for server-side API operations
# Used for: Contact creation, deal management, CRM integration
HUBSPOT_API_KEY=5a782283-38cb-4693-8574-face6faa1eab
```

### How HubSpot Integration Works

1. **Environment Variable:** `HUBSPOT_API_KEY` is read from `.env.local`
2. **Configuration:** Loaded via `src/lib/config.ts` (line 174)
3. **Service Initialization:** HubSpot service initializes with API key in `src/lib/hubspot/api.ts`
4. **API Operations:** Enables:
   - Contact creation and updates
   - Deal/opportunity management
   - CRM data synchronization
   - Progressive profiling for returning users
   - Lead routing and notifications

### Integration Files

The HubSpot integration uses the following files:
- **Configuration:** `apps/web/src/lib/config.ts`
- **Main Service:** `apps/web/src/lib/hubspot/api.ts`
- **Contacts Service:** `apps/web/src/lib/hubspot/contacts.ts`
- **Deals Service:** `apps/web/src/lib/hubspot/deals.ts`
- **Types:** `apps/web/src/lib/hubspot/types.ts`
- **Lead Routing:** `apps/web/src/lib/lead-routing/notifications.ts`

### Testing HubSpot Integration

To verify the HubSpot integration is working:

1. **Check Configuration Status:**
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   # Look for console log: "[HubSpot] Service initialized successfully with production configuration"
   # Or use the health check endpoint: http://localhost:3000/api/health
   ```

2. **Test Contact Form:**
   - Visit `/estimate` page
   - Fill out the estimate form
   - Submit the form
   - Check HubSpot CRM for new contact/deal creation

3. **Monitor Console Logs:**
   - Development mode shows detailed HubSpot API logs
   - Success/error messages appear in browser console
   - Server logs show API request/response details

### Important Security Notes

⚠️ **Security Best Practices:**
- ✅ API key is in `.env.local` (not committed to git)
- ✅ `.env.local` is in `.gitignore`
- ✅ Server-side only (not exposed to browser)
- ✅ Used for server-side API routes only
- ⚠️ **Never commit `.env.local` to version control**
- ⚠️ **Use different API keys for development/production**

### Production Deployment

When deploying to Vercel or other hosting:
1. Add `HUBSPOT_API_KEY` to environment variables in hosting dashboard
2. Consider using different API keys for preview/production environments
3. Verify API key permissions in HubSpot settings
4. Monitor API usage in HubSpot developer dashboard

### Required HubSpot Permissions

The API key should have these HubSpot scopes:
- `crm.objects.contacts.read`
- `crm.objects.contacts.write`
- `crm.objects.deals.read`
- `crm.objects.deals.write`
- `crm.schemas.contacts.read`
- `crm.schemas.deals.read`

### Restart Required

After adding the API key, restart your development server:
```bash
# Stop the current dev server (Ctrl+C)
pnpm dev
```

The HubSpot service will automatically detect the API key and switch from mock mode to production mode.
