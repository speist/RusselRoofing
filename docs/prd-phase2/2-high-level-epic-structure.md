# 2. High-Level Epic Structure

The work for this phase is organized into the following three epics:

* **Epic 5: Homepage Finalization & Content Integration:** Covers implementing the final V6 design, adding the new "Hiring" and "Instagram" sections, and populating the "Client Testimonials" and "Project Gallery" with real content.
* **Epic 6: Core Page Creation:** Covers the creation of the three missing navigation pages: `/services`, `/about`, and `/contact`, including gathering all necessary content and ensuring they match the new design aesthetic.
* **Epic 7: Production Readiness & Configuration:** A technical epic to handle all the high-priority environment configurations, including API keys, validation, and preparing for a custom domain.
