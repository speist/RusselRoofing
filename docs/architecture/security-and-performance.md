# Security and Performance

  * **Security:**
      * [cite\_start]All database access from the frontend will be subject to PostgreSQL Row Level Security (RLS) policies managed by Supabase Auth. [cite: 983]
      * [cite\_start]Environment variables must be used for all secrets and keys. [cite: 983]
      * [cite\_start]Input validation will be handled on serverless functions before database insertion. [cite: 984]
  * **Performance:**
      * [cite\_start]The frontend will be primarily statically generated (SSG) for fast initial loads. [cite: 985]
      * Vercel's Edge Network will serve assets globally.
      * [cite\_start]Images will be optimized using Next.js Image component. [cite: 985]
