# 1. Introduction & Integration Strategy

**Purpose:** This document outlines the architectural approach for implementing the "Homepage Redesign & Site Completion" PRD. It serves as the technical guide for developers, ensuring that all new features are built in a way that is consistent with, and safely integrated into, the existing application.

**Core Principle:** The primary goal is to minimize disruption. We will introduce new patterns and components for the redesign while ensuring existing functionality remains stable.

**Integration Approach:**

* **UI & Styling Integration:**
    * The new homepage design will be built using the code generated from Vercel v0, which is based on `shadcn/ui`.
    * We will use the `npx shadcn-ui@latest add` command to add these new components (like buttons, cards, carousels) into the existing project one by one, as needed by the `dev` agent.
    * The new global styles (fonts like "Skolar Latin", the updated red color, etc.) will be applied to the application's main layout file. This will ensure that while new components get the full new look, older pages will inherit the new fonts and colors, creating a more unified feel across the entire site.

* **Page & Routing Integration:**
    * The new pages (`/services`, `/about`, `/contact`) will be created as new routes within the existing Next.js application structure. This is a non-disruptive addition.
    * The homepage route (`/`) will be updated to render the new Vercel v0 component code.

* **Backend & API Integration:**
    * New backend functionality (like fetching the Instagram feed or Google Places testimonials) will be built as new, isolated serverless functions or API routes. This prevents interference with your existing backend logic.
