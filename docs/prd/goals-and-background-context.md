# Goals and Background Context
**Goals:**
* [cite_start]To provide customers with a transparent and immediate way to get a roofing/exterior project estimate. [cite: 440]
* [cite_start]To build trust through dynamic social proof and a professional, high-quality user experience. [cite: 440]
* [cite_start]To streamline the internal lead management process by capturing detailed information and integrating directly with HubSpot. [cite: 440]

**Background Context:**
[cite_start]This project addresses a key friction point in the customer journey for home and commercial exterior services. [cite: 441] [cite_start]By replacing a simple "Contact Us" form with an interactive "Instant Estimate" tool, we aim to significantly increase engagement and conversion. [cite: 441] [cite_start]The system is designed not just as a lead form, but as a value-add tool for the user, providing them with instant information while simultaneously qualifying them as a lead. [cite: 441] [cite_start]All design and functionality must adhere strictly to the provided Style Guide and State Design Brief to ensure a cohesive and trustworthy brand presentation. [cite: 441]
