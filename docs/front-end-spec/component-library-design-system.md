# Component Library / Design System

The core design system is defined in `russell-roofing-style-guide.md`. [cite\_start]Development will use this as a direct blueprint for creating a library of reusable React components. [cite: 694] Key components include:

  * [cite\_start]Primary & Secondary Buttons [cite: 697]
  * [cite\_start]Cards (for services, reviews, etc.) [cite: 697]
  * [cite\_start]Styled Input Fields [cite: 697]
