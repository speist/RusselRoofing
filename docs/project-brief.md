# Project Brief: Russell Roofing & Exteriors - Lead Capture & Conversion System

## Executive Summary
[cite_start]This project will create a modern, high-converting lead capture and conversion system for Russell Roofing & Exteriors. [cite: 237] [cite_start]The core of the project is an interactive, multi-step "Instant Estimate" form designed to engage users and gather detailed project information. [cite: 238] [cite_start]This will be supported by dynamic social proof, a comprehensive project gallery, and seamless integration with HubSpot to streamline the sales process and build customer trust. [cite: 238, 240]

## Problem Statement
[cite_start]Prospective roofing clients currently face a high-friction process when seeking estimates. [cite: 239] [cite_start]There is a need for an immediate, user-friendly way for homeowners and property managers to get a preliminary quote without waiting for a callback.

[cite: 239]

## Proposed Solution
The proposed solution is a new website feature centered around an "Instant Estimate" calculator. [cite_start]This tool will guide users through a simple, visually engaging process to input their project details and receive a real-time price range. [cite: 240] [cite_start]The system will use progressive profiling and smart-lead routing to qualify and direct leads efficiently. [cite: 240] [cite_start]Trust will be established through dynamic social proof, location-based testimonials, and prominent display of certifications. [cite: 240]
