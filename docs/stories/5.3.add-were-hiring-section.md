## Dev Notes

### Section Content Requirements
[Source: docs/prd-phase2/epic-5-homepage-finalization-content-integration.md]

The "We're Hiring!" section must include:
- Section heading: "We're Hiring!"
- Introductory text about joining the Russell Roofing team
- Contact email: `info@russellroofing.com`
- Three specific positions:
  - FOREMAN
  - SUPERINTENDENT
  - ROOFING LABORER

### Component Organization
[Source: docs/architecture-phase2/2-component-architecture-integration.md]
- New hiring section component goes in `src/components/home/` directory
- Follow V6 design patterns established in Story 5.1
- Use existing UI components from `src/components/ui/` where applicable

### Design Consistency
[Source: Story 5.1 - V6 Design Implementation]
- Background: Light Grey (#F5F3F0) for floating page effect
- Primary color: #960120 (updated from #8B1538)
- Typography: Use "Skolar Latin" for serif headlines
- Maintain consistent spacing and padding with other sections

### Tech Stack Context
[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Frontend Framework: Next.js ~14.1.0
- UI Components: Can use Radix UI for accessible components
- Styling: Tailwind CSS ~3.4.1
- TypeScript: ~5.3.3

### Suggested Component Structure
```typescript
// src/components/home/hiring-section.tsx
interface JobPosition {
  title: string;
  department?: string;
  type?: 'full-time' | 'part-time';
}

const positions: JobPosition[] = [
  { title: 'FOREMAN' },
  { title: 'SUPERINTENDENT' },
  { title: 'ROOFING LABORER' }
];
```

### Email Integration
- Use `mailto:info@russellroofing.com` for email links
- Consider adding subject line: `?subject=Job Application: [Position Name]`
- Ensure email links are clearly clickable with proper styling

### Accessibility Considerations
[Source: docs/russell-roofing-style-guide.md]
- Ensure proper heading hierarchy (likely h2 for section heading)
- Email links must have clear link text, not just the email address
- Cards should be keyboard navigable if interactive
- Maintain color contrast ratios for all text
- Consider adding ARIA labels for screen readers

### Content Suggestions
While the PRD specifies the basic requirements, consider this introductory text structure:
- Brief welcome message about Russell Roofing as an employer
- Company values or benefits (growth opportunities, team culture)
- Clear instruction on how to apply (email with resume)
- Equal opportunity employer statement (if applicable)

### Visual Design Considerations
- Consider using card-based layout for job positions
- Add subtle shadows following V6 design patterns
- Use consistent border radius (8px per style guide)
- Apply hover states to cards if they're interactive
- Consider adding a background pattern or color to distinguish section

## Testing

### Testing Standards
[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Frontend Testing: Vitest ~1.2.2
- E2E Testing: Playwright ~1.41.2
- Test responsive behavior across all breakpoints
- Verify email links function correctly
- Test keyboard navigation through the section

### Key Test Scenarios
- Section renders with all three job positions
- Email link opens default mail client
- Responsive layout adjusts properly at breakpoints
- Cards display consistently across browsers
- Section integrates smoothly with homepage
- Content remains readable on all screen sizes
