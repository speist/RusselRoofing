# Story 7.1: Implement Production Environment Configuration

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** the application to use a separate set of production-ready API keys and settings,
**so that** we can safely connect to live services without affecting development.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. An example environment file (`.env.example`) is created or updated with placeholders for all required production keys, specifically `HUBSPOT_API_KEY`.
2. The application's code is configured to use the production variables when running in a production environment.
3. The Google Places API key is correctly read from the production environment variables.

## Dev Notes

### Current Environment Variable Usage
[Source: Previous stories and integrations]

Based on implemented features, the application requires:
- **HubSpot Integration**: API keys for contacts, deals, and webhooks
- **Google Places API**: For testimonials and business information
- **Instagram API**: For social feed integration
- **Facebook App**: For Instagram Basic Display API

### Environment Variable Categories

**HubSpot Configuration**:
```bash
# HubSpot API Configuration
HUBSPOT_API_KEY=your_hubspot_private_app_token
HUBSPOT_PORTAL_ID=your_hubspot_portal_id
HUBSPOT_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_webhook_verification_token
```

**Google Services**:
```bash
# Google Places API for testimonials and business info
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY=your_google_places_api_key
RUSSELL_ROOFING_PLACE_ID=your_google_places_business_id
```

**Instagram Integration**:
```bash
# Instagram Basic Display API
INSTAGRAM_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_long_lived_access_token
INSTAGRAM_USER_ID=russellroofingcompany_user_id
FACEBOOK_APP_ID=your_facebook_app_id
FACEBOOK_APP_SECRET=your_facebook_app_secret
```

**Application Configuration**:
```bash
# Next.js Configuration
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://russellroofing.com
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_nextauth_secret_key

# Analytics and Monitoring
NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID=your_google_analytics_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_VERCEL_URL=your_vercel_domain
```

### Environment Variable Naming Conventions
[Source: Next.js documentation standards]

**Client-Side Variables**: Prefix with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`
- Exposed to the browser
- Used for public API keys and configuration
- Examples: `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY`

**Server-Side Variables**: No prefix required
- Only available on the server
- Used for private API keys and secrets
- Examples: `HUBSPOT_API_KEY`, `INSTAGRAM_ACCESS_TOKEN`

### Production vs Development Configuration

**Development Environment** (`.env.local`):
- Test API keys and sandbox environments
- Local development URLs
- Debug logging enabled
- Mock data when appropriate

**Production Environment** (Vercel Dashboard):
- Live API keys and production services
- Custom domain URLs
- Error logging and monitoring
- Real data integration

### Security Implementation Strategy

**API Key Protection**:
- Server-side variables for sensitive keys
- No hardcoded secrets in client code
- Environment-specific key rotation
- Rate limiting and usage monitoring

**Git Security**:
```gitignore
# Environment files
.env
.env.local
.env.development.local
.env.test.local
.env.production.local
.env.*.local
```

### Vercel Environment Variable Configuration
[Source: docs/architecture-phase2/4-production-readiness-architecture.md]

**Configuration Strategy**:
1. Use Vercel project dashboard for production variables
2. Environment-specific variable sets (development, preview, production)
3. Team access controls for sensitive variables
4. Variable encryption at rest
5. Audit logging for variable changes

### Environment Variable Loading Order
Next.js loads environment variables in this order:
1. `.env.local` (always loaded, should be gitignored)
2. `.env.development` (loaded when NODE_ENV=development)
3. `.env.production` (loaded when NODE_ENV=production)
4. `.env` (always loaded)

### API Integration Updates Required

**HubSpot Integration** [Source: Stories 4.1, 4.2]:
- Update API client initialization
- Environment-aware endpoint configuration
- Production webhook URL configuration
- Rate limiting for production usage

**Google Places Integration** [Source: Story 5.4]:
- Production API key configuration
- Rate limiting and quota management
- Error handling for production environment
- Caching configuration for production

**Instagram Integration** [Source: Story 5.2]:
- Production access token management
- Token refresh automation
- Error handling and fallback systems
- Production rate limiting

### Environment Configuration Validation
Create utility for environment validation:
```typescript
// src/lib/env-validation.ts
const requiredEnvVars = [
  'HUBSPOT_API_KEY',
  'NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY',
  'INSTAGRAM_ACCESS_TOKEN',
  'FACEBOOK_APP_SECRET'
] as const;

export function validateEnvironment() {
  const missing = requiredEnvVars.filter(
    (varName) => !process.env[varName]
  );
  
  if (missing.length > 0) {
    throw new Error(`Missing required environment variables: ${missing.join(', ')}`);
  }
}
```

### Documentation Requirements
Create comprehensive documentation including:
- Variable-by-variable setup instructions
- Production deployment checklist
- API key generation guides
- Troubleshooting common issues
- Security best practices
- Vercel-specific configuration steps

## Testing

### Testing Standards
[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Test environment variable loading in different environments
- Validate API integrations work with production configuration
- Test error handling for missing variables
- Verify no sensitive data leaks to client-side

### Key Test Scenarios
- All required environment variables are properly documented
- Production API keys work correctly in staging environment
- Environment variable validation catches missing variables
- API integrations handle production rate limits properly
- No sensitive variables are exposed to client-side code
- Vercel deployment uses correct environment variables
