# Story 2.1: Instant Estimate Step 1 - Property Information

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** potential customer,
**I want** to provide my property information in an intuitive first step,
**so that** I can begin the estimate process easily.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A property type selection interface is created with visual cards (Single Family, Multi-Family, Commercial).
2. Google Places API address autocomplete is implemented and functional.
3. Progress indicators show the user is on step 1 of 3.
4. The "Continue" button is disabled until required selections are made.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Create property type selection interface (AC: 1)
  - [x] Create PropertyTypeCard component with icons and hover states
  - [x] Implement single selection logic for property types
  - [x] Add selection animations and visual feedback
  - [x] Style cards according to design specification (200px height, 8px radius)
- [x] Implement Google Places address autocomplete (AC: 2)
  - [x] Set up Google Places API integration
  - [x] Create AddressInput component with autocomplete
  - [x] Style dropdown with custom design (shadow, 6px radius)
  - [x] Handle address selection and validation
- [x] Create progress indicator system (AC: 3)
  - [x] Create ProgressDots component showing 3 steps
  - [x] Highlight current step in Primary Burgundy (#8B1538)
  - [x] Add scale animation for active step
  - [x] Make progress indicator responsive
- [x] Implement form validation and continue logic (AC: 4)
  - [x] Add form state management (React Hook Form or similar)
  - [x] Disable continue button when selections incomplete
  - [x] Style disabled state (#BDBDBD background)
  - [x] Add smooth transition to step 2

## Dev Notes

### Design Specifications
[Source: russell-roofing-state-brief.md - Step 1: Property Information State]

#### Property Type Cards
- **Size**: 200px height, 8px radius
- **Icons**: 48px, Primary Burgundy stroke, animate to filled on selection
- **Selected State**: Primary Burgundy border (2px), subtle background tint (#8B1538 at 5% opacity)
- **Hover State**: translateY(-4px) and enhanced shadow
- **Mobile**: Cards stack vertically with 16px spacing, full width minus 32px padding

#### Progress Indicators
- **Active Step**: Primary Burgundy (#8B1538) with scale(1.2) animation
- **Inactive Steps**: Gray color, smaller scale
- **Design**: Dot-based progress indicator

#### Address Input
- **Integration**: Google Places API with custom styling
- **Appearance**: Smooth height animation (250ms ease-out) when revealed
- **Dropdown**: Custom styling with shadow and 6px radius

#### Continue Button
- **Enabled**: Primary button styling from style guide
- **Disabled**: #BDBDBD background until property type selected
- **Behavior**: Only enabled when property type is selected

### Technical Requirements

#### Google Places API Setup
- Install `@googlemaps/places` or use script tag
- Configure API key in environment variables
- Implement autocomplete with debouncing
- Handle API errors gracefully

#### Form State Management
- Use React Hook Form for form validation
- Track property type selection
- Track address completion
- Enable/disable continue button based on completion

#### Component Structure
```
components/
├── estimate/
│   ├── EstimateForm.tsx (main container)
│   ├── ProgressDots.tsx
│   ├── PropertyTypeCard.tsx
│   ├── AddressInput.tsx
│   └── step1/
│       └── PropertyInfoStep.tsx
└── ui/ (existing from previous stories)
```

#### Animation Requirements
- Property type card hover: translateY(-4px) with shadow enhancement
- Selection animation: border and background color transition
- Progress dot animation: scale(1.2) for active step
- Address input reveal: smooth height animation (250ms ease-out)

### Technical Constraints
- Must use Google Places API for address autocomplete
- Form state must be preserved (NFR5 requirement)
- Response time <200ms for interactive elements (NFR2)
- Mobile responsive design matching style guide breakpoints

### Environment Variables
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

## Testing
- [ ] Property type cards display correctly on all screen sizes
- [ ] Selection state visually updates when property type is chosen
- [ ] Google Places autocomplete provides address suggestions
- [ ] Selected address populates the input field correctly
- [ ] Progress indicator shows step 1 as active
- [ ] Continue button is disabled until property type is selected
- [ ] Continue button navigates to step 2 when clicked
- [ ] All animations and transitions work smoothly
- [ ] Form handles API errors gracefully
- [ ] Touch targets meet 44px minimum on mobile
