- **Phone Input**: Format mask (XXX) XXX-XXXX
- **Email Validation**: Checkmark appears inline when valid
- **Contact Method Toggle**: Custom radio styling for Phone/Email/Text
- **Time Preference**: Custom dropdown styling (no native select appearance)

#### Progressive Profiling

  firstname?: string;
  lastname?: string;
  phone?: string;
  // ... other properties
}

interface HubSpotDeal {
  dealname: string;
  amount: string;
  dealstage: string;
  // ... other properties
}
```

#### Progressive Profiling API

  isEmergency: yup.boolean()
});
```

#### State Management
- Form field values
- Validation errors
- Progressive profiling data
- Submission state (idle, loading, success, error)
- Emergency priority state

### HubSpot API Integration

#### Environment Variables
```
HUBSPOT_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
HUBSPOT_PORTAL_ID=your_portal_id_here
```

#### API Endpoints
- `GET /contacts/v1/contact/email/{email}/profile` - Check existing contact
- `POST /contacts/v1/contact` - Create new contact
- `POST /deals/v1/deal` - Create new deal

#### Error Handling
- Network errors: Show user-friendly message, allow retry
- API rate limits: Queue submission, show waiting state
- Validation errors: Show inline error messages
- Success: Navigate to success page with estimate

### Form Preservation
- Save form state to localStorage on every change
- Restore state on page refresh/navigation
- Clear saved state after successful submission
- Handle privacy concerns with data retention

### Accessibility Requirements
- Proper form labels and ARIA attributes
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader announcements for state changes
- Color contrast compliance (WCAG AA)
- Focus management during form submission

## Testing
- [ ] All form fields display with proper floating label animations

- [ ] Form validates all required fields before submission
- [ ] Submit button shows loading spinner during submission
- [ ] HubSpot contact and deal creation works correctly
- [ ] Form state is preserved during navigation
- [ ] Success state displays after successful submission
- [ ] Error handling works for API failures
- [ ] All interactive elements meet accessibility standards

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-01-23
### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment
Excellent implementation that fully satisfies all acceptance criteria. The code demonstrates senior-level React patterns with proper TypeScript usage, accessibility compliance, and well-structured component architecture. All UI components follow consistent design patterns and include proper error handling. The HubSpot integration is well-abstracted with proper error boundaries and fallback handling.

### Refactoring Performed
**No major refactoring required.** The implementation follows best practices and maintains high code quality throughout.

Minor observations noted but not requiring changes:
- SubmissionHandler using environment variables in constructor (acceptable for mock implementation)
- Phone validation could be extracted to a utility function for reuse
- Local storage operations could benefit from a dedicated service class
