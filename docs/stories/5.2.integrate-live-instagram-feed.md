## Dev Notes

### Instagram Integration Architecture
[Source: docs/architecture-phase2/3-new-page-architecture-content-strategy.md]

The implementation requires a server-side approach to protect access tokens:
- Create a serverless function (API route in Next.js) that runs on the server
- This function fetches the latest posts from the Instagram API
- Sends only necessary data to the client component
- This approach keeps tokens secure and prevents client-side exposure

### Tech Stack Context
[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Frontend Framework: Next.js ~14.1.0 (supports API routes)
- TypeScript: ~5.3.3
- Backend Language: TypeScript for serverless functions

### Component Organization
[Source: docs/architecture-phase2/2-component-architecture-integration.md]
- New Instagram component goes in `src/components/home/` directory
- Follow V6 design patterns established in Story 5.1
- Use `src/components/ui/` for any reusable UI elements

### Instagram Basic Display API Implementation

**Chosen Approach**: Instagram Basic Display API with server-side caching
- Most reliable and professional solution
- Full control over display and behavior
- No ongoing third-party costs
- Aligns with enterprise-grade architecture

**Key Implementation Details**:
- Facebook App creation required at developers.facebook.com
- Instagram Basic Display product must be added to the app
- Token refresh required every 60 days (implement automated refresh)
- Rate limits: 200 requests per hour per user (hence caching strategy)
- App Review may be required for production use

**API Route Structure**:
```typescript
// /app/api/instagram/route.ts
interface InstagramPost {
  id: string;
  media_url: string;
  caption?: string;
  permalink: string;
  media_type: 'IMAGE' | 'VIDEO' | 'CAROUSEL_ALBUM';
  timestamp: string;
}

interface InstagramResponse {
  posts: InstagramPost[];
  error?: string;
}
```

### Environment Variables Required
```
INSTAGRAM_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_long_lived_access_token_here
INSTAGRAM_USER_ID=russellroofingcompany_id
FACEBOOK_APP_ID=your_facebook_app_id
FACEBOOK_APP_SECRET=your_facebook_app_secret
```

### Token Refresh Strategy
Since Instagram Basic Display API tokens expire every 60 days, implement automated refresh:
- Create a `/app/api/instagram/refresh-token/route.ts` endpoint
- Set up a cron job or scheduled function to refresh tokens before expiry
- Store token expiry date alongside the token
- Refresh when token has less than 7 days remaining
- Log refresh attempts and failures for monitoring

### Grid Layout Specifications
- Desktop: 3 columns × 2 rows
- Tablet: 3 columns × 2 rows
- Mobile: 2 columns × 3 rows
- Gap: 16px between images
- Aspect ratio: 1:1 (square) for all images
- Max section width: Match homepage content width

### Styling Requirements
[Source: Story 5.1 implementation]
- Follow V6 color scheme with #960120 accent colors
- Maintain consistent spacing with other homepage sections
- Use established hover effects from style guide
- Ensure images have proper border radius (8px)

### Performance Considerations
- Implement lazy loading for images below the fold
- Use Next.js Image component for optimization
- Cache API responses for 1 hour minimum
- Provide low-quality image placeholders during load
- Consider static generation with ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration)

## Testing

### Testing Standards
[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Frontend Testing: Vitest ~1.2.2
- E2E Testing: Playwright ~1.41.2
- Test API route with mocked Instagram responses
- Test component rendering with various data states
- Test responsive grid layout across breakpoints
- Verify error handling and fallback behavior

### Key Test Scenarios
- Successful API response with 6 images
- API failure triggering fallback content
- Empty Instagram feed handling
- Network timeout scenarios
- Token expiration handling
- Image loading performance
