# Story 1.1: Project Initialization

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** a configured monorepo with a Next.js frontend app,

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
This is the first story in the project - no previous story context available.

### Tech Stack Configuration
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Frontend Language**: TypeScript ~5.3.3 for type safety
- **Frontend Framework**: Next.js ~14.1.0 with SSR, SSG, and API routes
- **CSS Framework**: Tailwind CSS ~3.4.1 for utility-first styling
- **Package Manager**: pnpm (implied from development workflow)

```

### Development Setup Requirements
[Source: architecture/development-workflow.md]
- **Prerequisites**: Node.js (~20.x), pnpm (~8.x)
- **Development Command**: `pnpm dev` to run Next.js development server
- **Environment Setup**: Will need `.env.local.example` file for future Supabase configuration

### File Locations
Based on project structure requirements:
- Root monorepo files: `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, root `package.json`
- Next.js app: `apps/web/` directory with standard Next.js structure
- TypeScript configs: Both root and app-specific `tsconfig.json` files
- Tailwind config: `apps/web/tailwind.config.ts`
- Main page: `apps/web/src/app/page.tsx` (App Router structure)

### Technical Constraints
- Must use pnpm workspaces for monorepo management
- Must use Next.js App Router (not Pages Router) based on project structure
- TypeScript must be configured for the entire workspace
- Tailwind CSS must be properly integrated with Next.js

### Testing Requirements
No specific testing guidance found in architecture docs for this foundational story.

## Testing
No specific testing requirements for this foundational setup story beyond ensuring the development server runs and displays the Hello World page.

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-07-23
### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment
**❌ CRITICAL ISSUE: Implementation does not match acceptance criteria**

The story explicitly requires "A basic 'Hello World' page is viewable when running the development server" (AC #4), but the implemented page.tsx contains a comprehensive design system showcase with complex components, theming, and styling features that are far beyond the scope of this foundational story.

**Technical Infrastructure Assessment:**
- ✅ Monorepo structure properly configured with pnpm workspaces
- ✅ Next.js application correctly created in apps/web with TypeScript support
- ✅ Tailwind CSS integration is comprehensive and well-configured
- ✅ Development tooling (lint, typecheck) working correctly
- ✅ TypeScript configuration properly set up with path mapping

**Architectural Issues:**
- ❌ Page implementation includes components (@/components/ui/*) that are not part of this story's scope
- ❌ Complex theming system implemented without requirements
- ❌ Advanced design system features beyond foundational setup requirements

### Refactoring Performed
**File**: apps/web/src/app/page.tsx
- **Change**: Replaced complex design system showcase with simple Hello World implementation
- **Why**: Story AC #4 specifically requires "basic Hello World page", not a design system showcase
- **How**: Simplified to minimal viable implementation that meets acceptance criteria while maintaining proper project structure

### Compliance Check
- Coding Standards: ✓ (No specific standards file found, but code follows Next.js/React best practices)
- Project Structure: ✓ (Follows unified-project-structure.md correctly)
- Testing Strategy: ✓ (No testing requirements specified for this foundational story)
- All ACs Met: ❌ (AC #4 not met - implemented complex showcase instead of simple Hello World)

### Improvements Checklist
[Check off items I handled myself, leave unchecked for dev to address]

- [x] Refactored page.tsx to match story requirements (apps/web/src/app/page.tsx)
- [x] Verified monorepo structure matches specification
- [x] Confirmed TypeScript and Tailwind CSS configurations are correct
- [x] Validated development scripts work properly
- [ ] Consider preserving complex showcase as separate demo page for future reference
- [ ] Document the component library work done (appears to be from a future story)

### Security Review
No security concerns identified in this foundational setup. Standard Next.js security practices are followed.

### Performance Considerations
- ✅ Minimal bundle size for Hello World implementation
- ✅ Proper TypeScript configuration for build optimization
- ✅ Tailwind CSS configured for production builds

### Final Status
[✓ Approved - Ready for Done]

**Note**: The original complex implementation showed excellent technical work but was out of scope for this story. The simplified implementation now correctly fulfills all acceptance criteria while maintaining the solid technical foundation that was established.
