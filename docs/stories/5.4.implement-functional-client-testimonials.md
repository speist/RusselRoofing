# Story 5.4: Implement Functional Client Testimonials

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** potential customer,
**I want** to see real, recent reviews,
**so that** I can build trust in the company.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The "Client Testimonials" section is implemented as an auto-playing carousel.
2. The component is connected to the Google Places API using the key from the environment variables.
3. It successfully fetches and displays real 5-star reviews.
4. If the API fails, the component gracefully falls back to a set of 6 hardcoded placeholder reviews.

## Dev Notes

### Google Places API Integration
[Source: docs/architecture-phase2/3-new-page-architecture-content-strategy.md]

The implementation should use a client-side component (`"use client"`) that securely fetches reviews using the Google Places API key. However, for better security, consider using an API route pattern similar to Instagram integration.

### Existing Review System
[Source: apps/web/src/components/social-proof/, apps/web/src/data/reviews.ts]

The project already has a complete review system:
- **Review Interface**: Defined in `src/types/review.ts`
- **ReviewCarousel Component**: Located at `src/components/social-proof/ReviewCarousel.tsx`
- **Sample Data**: 6 hardcoded reviews in `src/data/reviews.ts`
- **Supporting Components**: ReviewCard, NavigationControls, ReviewModal

### Google Places API Integration Strategy

**Recommended Approach**: Server-side API route for security
- Create `/app/api/reviews/route.ts` to protect API keys
- Fetch reviews server-side and transform to Review interface
- Return only necessary data to client component

**Google Places API Details**:
- Endpoint: Places API - Place Details
- Required: Place ID for Russell Roofing business
- Fields needed: `reviews,rating,user_ratings_total`
- Filter: Only reviews with 5-star ratings

### Data Transformation Requirements

**Google Places Review â†’ Review Interface Mapping**:
```typescript
// Google Places Review structure
interface GooglePlacesReview {
  author_name: string;
  rating: number;
  text: string;
  time: number; // Unix timestamp
  author_url?: string;
  profile_photo_url?: string;
}

// Transform to existing Review interface
interface Review {
  id: string;              // Generate from author_name + time
  customerName: string;    // author_name
  neighborhood?: string;   // Extract from text or leave undefined
  rating: number;          // rating (filter for 5 only)
  reviewText: string;      // text
  shortText: string;       // Truncated version of text
  date: string;            // Convert time to YYYY-MM-DD format
  verified: boolean;       // true for Google reviews
  platform: 'google';     // Always 'google'
  response?: string;       // Business response if available
}
```

### Environment Variables Required
```
GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY=AIzaSyAs120cQnKSB6XYgEcTqcmvkwxm21gwTgo
RUSSELL_ROOFING_PLACE_ID=your_place_id_here
```

### Component Architecture
[Source: docs/architecture-phase2/2-component-architecture-integration.md]

Since testimonials carousel already exists, we need to:
1. Enhance existing component to use live data
2. Maintain backward compatibility with fallback data
3. Follow established patterns from Instagram integration

### API Route Structure
```typescript
// /app/api/reviews/route.ts
interface GooglePlacesResponse {
  result: {
    reviews: GooglePlacesReview[];
    rating: number;
    user_ratings_total: number;
  };
}

interface ReviewsApiResponse {
  reviews: Review[];
  source: 'live' | 'fallback';
  error?: string;
}
```

### Caching Strategy
- **Server-side**: Cache Google Places responses for 6 hours
- **Client-side**: Use SWR or React Query for data fetching
- **Quotas**: Google Places API has daily request limits
- **Monitoring**: Track API usage and fallback activation

### Auto-Playing Carousel Requirements
[Source: Existing ReviewCarousel component]

The existing carousel already supports:
- Auto-rotation with configurable interval (default 5000ms)
- Pause on hover functionality
- Manual navigation controls
- Mobile-friendly scroll behavior
- Smooth transitions between reviews

### Fallback Implementation
The component should gracefully fall back to the existing `sampleReviews` when:
- Google Places API is unavailable
- API key is invalid or missing
- API quota is exceeded
- Network connectivity issues
- Reviews fetching fails for any reason

### Performance Considerations
- Implement lazy loading for carousel images
- Cache transformed review data
- Minimize API calls through proper caching
- Use Next.js Image component for profile photos (if used)
- Consider static generation with ISR for review content

### Testing Strategy
- Mock Google Places API responses for testing
- Test fallback behavior with various failure scenarios
- Verify 5-star filtering works correctly
- Test data transformation accuracy
- Ensure auto-play functionality works across devices

## Testing

### Testing Standards
[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Frontend Testing: Vitest ~1.2.2
- E2E Testing: Playwright ~1.41.2
- Test API route with mocked Google Places responses
- Test component rendering with live and fallback data
- Test auto-play carousel functionality

### Key Test Scenarios
- Successful Google Places API response with 5-star reviews
- API failure triggering fallback to sample reviews
- Mixed rating reviews (ensure only 5-star are displayed)
- Empty or no reviews from Google Places
- Network timeout scenarios
- Auto-play carousel behavior
- Manual navigation controls
- Responsive layout across breakpoints
