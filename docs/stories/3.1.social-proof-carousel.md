- **Mobile**: 1.2 cards visible with smooth scroll
- **Card Styling**: White background, subtle shadow, 8px radius
- **Container**: 100% width with overflow hidden

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-01-23
### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment
Excellent implementation of the social proof carousel system. The code demonstrates strong architectural patterns, comprehensive TypeScript integration, and thoughtful component composition. All acceptance criteria have been met with high-quality, maintainable code that follows React best practices.

### Refactoring Performed
- **File**: `src/components/social-proof/ReviewCarousel.tsx`
  - **Change**: Fixed mobile carousel navigation logic that was conflicting between transform and scroll behavior

  - **How**: Implemented proper scroll-based navigation with refs and scrollTo API for smooth mobile experience

- **File**: `src/components/ui/StarRating.tsx`
  - **Change**: Added useMemo optimization for star rendering and moved sizeClasses inside useMemo
  - **Why**: Prevents unnecessary re-renders of complex star SVG elements on parent component updates
  - **How**: Memoized the star array generation with proper dependencies, improving performance
