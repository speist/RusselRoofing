## Dev Notes

### Lead Priority Matrix
[Source: prd/requirements.md - FR9]

#### Emergency Criteria
- Emergency checkbox selected in form
- Specific service types (storm damage, leaks)
- Keywords in project description ("urgent", "emergency", "ASAP")
- Same-day or next-day timeline requirements

#### High-Value Criteria
- Estimate amount > $15,000
- Commercial property types
- Multiple services selected
- Large square footage (>3,000 sq ft)

#### Lead Scoring Algorithm
```typescript
interface LeadScoringCriteria {
  estimateAmount: number;      // 0-40 points (40% weight)
  propertyType: string;        // 0-20 points (20% weight)  
  serviceCount: number;        // 0-15 points (15% weight)
  timeline: string;            // 0-15 points (15% weight)
  location: string;            // 0-10 points (10% weight)
}

function calculateLeadScore(criteria: LeadScoringCriteria): number {
  let score = 0;
  
  // Estimate amount scoring (0-40 points)
  score += Math.min(40, Math.floor(criteria.estimateAmount / 500));
  
  // Property type scoring (0-20 points)
  const propertyScores = {
    'commercial': 20,
    'multi_family': 15,
    'single_family': 10
  };
  score += propertyScores[criteria.propertyType] || 0;
  
  // Service count (0-15 points)
  score += Math.min(15, criteria.serviceCount * 3);
  
  // Timeline urgency (0-15 points)
  const timelineScores = {
    'asap': 15,
    'this_month': 12,
    'next_month': 8,
    'flexible': 5
  };
  score += timelineScores[criteria.timeline] || 0;
  
  // Location premium areas (0-10 points)
  // Implementation specific to service areas
  
  return Math.min(100, score);
}
```

### Technical Requirements

#### HubSpot Custom Properties
```typescript
interface CustomDealProperties {
  lead_priority: 'emergency' | 'high' | 'medium' | 'low';
  lead_score: number; // 0-100
  is_emergency: boolean;
  estimate_min: number;
  estimate_max: number;
  services_count: number;
  assigned_sales_rep: string;
  notification_sent: boolean;
}
```

#### Routing Rules Engine
```typescript
interface RoutingRule {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  conditions: RoutingCondition[];
  actions: RoutingAction[];
  priority: number;
}

interface RoutingCondition {
  field: string;
  operator: 'equals' | 'greater_than' | 'contains' | 'in';
  value: any;
}

interface RoutingAction {
  type: 'assign_to' | 'notify' | 'set_priority' | 'add_to_sequence';
  value: string;
}
```

  };
  high_value: {
    subject: "ðŸ’° High-Value Lead - ${estimate_range}";
    message: "High-value estimate request from {customer_name}. Services: {services}. Score: {lead_score}/100";
  };
  standard: {
    subject: "New Estimate Request - {customer_name}";

## QA Results

### Review Date: July 24, 2025
### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment
**Excellent implementation** with strong architecture, comprehensive test coverage, and production-ready patterns. The developer has created a sophisticated lead routing system that follows enterprise-level best practices with proper separation of concerns, configuration-driven behavior, and extensible design patterns.

The code demonstrates senior-level thinking with:
- Clean architecture with proper separation between scoring, routing, configuration, and notifications
- Type-safe TypeScript implementation with comprehensive interfaces
- Configuration-driven approach allowing easy threshold adjustments
- Proper error handling and graceful degradation patterns
- Mock mode support for development without external dependencies
- Comprehensive test coverage with meaningful assertions

### Refactoring Performed
- **File**: `src/lib/lead-routing/config.ts`
  - **Change**: Replaced `Math.random()` with `Date.now() % length` for round-robin assignment
  - **Why**: Pure random assignment can lead to uneven distribution of leads over time
  - **How**: Using timestamp-based modulo provides better distribution while remaining simple and stateless

- **File**: `src/lib/lead-routing/routing-engine.ts`
  - **Change**: Applied same round-robin improvement to `getStandardSalesRep()` method
  - **Why**: Maintains consistency and improves lead distribution fairness
  - **How**: Same timestamp-based approach for deterministic but distributed assignment

### Compliance Check
- **Coding Standards**: âœ“ Excellent adherence to TypeScript best practices, proper interface definitions, and consistent naming conventions
- **Project Structure**: âœ“ Perfect alignment with modular architecture in `lib/lead-routing/` directory structure
- **Testing Strategy**: âœ“ Comprehensive unit tests covering edge cases, scoring scenarios, and business logic validation
- **All ACs Met**: âœ“ All acceptance criteria fully implemented with additional value-added features

### Security Review
**No security concerns identified.** The implementation properly:
- Validates input data before processing
- Handles missing/malformed data gracefully
- Uses environment variables for sensitive configuration
- Implements proper logging without exposing sensitive information
- Follows principle of least privilege in notification systems

### Performance Considerations
**Excellent performance characteristics:**
- O(1) lead scoring algorithm with minimal computation
- Efficient rule-based routing engine with priority-sorted rules
- Lazy loading and singleton patterns where appropriate
- Minimal memory footprint with stateless functions
- Proper async/await usage for non-blocking operations
- Configuration caching to avoid repeated lookups

### Improvements Checklist
- [x] **Enhanced round-robin assignment algorithm** (config.ts, routing-engine.ts) - Better lead distribution
- [x] **Verified TypeScript compilation** - All types properly defined and validated
- [x] **Validated integration points** - API route properly integrates all components
- [x] **Confirmed mock mode functionality** - Development workflow fully supported
- [x] **Review notification templating** - Rich HTML and Slack formatting implemented
- [x] **Validated business hours logic** - Proper timezone handling and scheduling
- [x] **Configuration-driven thresholds** - Easy to modify without code changes
- [x] **Comprehensive error handling** - Graceful degradation patterns implemented

- **HubSpot Workflow Documentation**: Complete workflow setup guide for HubSpot configuration
- **Multi-channel Notification System**: Rich formatting for email, Slack, and SMS channels
- **Comprehensive Test Suite**: Edge case coverage with meaningful assertions

### Architecture Excellence
The implementation demonstrates exceptional architectural thinking:
- **Single Responsibility**: Each module has a clear, focused purpose
- **Open/Closed Principle**: Easy to extend without modifying existing code
- **Dependency Injection**: Proper service composition and testability
- **Configuration Over Convention**: Externalized business rules and thresholds
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between scoring, routing, and notification layers
