- **Gaps**: 16px mobile, 24px desktop
- **Aspect Ratios**: Maintain with CSS aspect-ratio or padding-hack
- **Loading**: Blurred low-res version (blur(20px)) fades to sharp image

#### Image Hover States (Desktop)
- **Overlay**: Dark overlay (rgba(0,0,0,0.7)) fades in
- **Content**: Service type label, project title, hover animations
- **Transition**: Smooth fade transitions matching site standards

#### Filter Interface
- **Layout**: Horizontal filter buttons above gallery
- **Active State**: Primary Burgundy background (#8B1538)
- **Inactive State**: Ghost button styling
- **Mobile**: Horizontal scroll with snap points

#### Lightbox Design
- **Background**: Full-screen dark overlay
- **Image**: Centered with max dimensions
- **Details Panel**: Side panel or bottom overlay with project information
- **Navigation**: Arrow buttons for previous/next navigation
- **Close**: X button and click-outside-to-close functionality

#### Lazy Loading Implementation
- Use Intersection Observer API
- Trigger 200px before viewport entry
- Progressive loading with blur-up technique
- Maintain aspect ratios during loading

#### Masonry Grid CSS
```css
.gallery-grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(300px, 1fr));
  grid-auto-flow: dense;
  gap: 16px;
}

@media (min-width: 768px) {
  .gallery-grid {
    gap: 24px;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(350px, 1fr));
  }
}
```

### Image Optimization
- Multiple image sizes (thumbnail, medium, large)
- Modern formats (WebP, AVIF) with fallbacks
- Responsive images with srcset
- Lazy loading with placeholder images
- CDN integration for performance

### Filter Animation
- Smooth height transitions for grid changes
- Fade out filtered items, fade in visible items
- Maintain grid layout during transitions
- Update URL parameters for bookmarkable filtered views

### Lightbox Features

- **Keyboard Support**: Arrow keys, escape to close, tab navigation
- **Touch Gestures**: Swipe to navigate on mobile
- **Zoom**: Pinch to zoom on touch devices
- **Details**: Project information overlay
- **Sharing**: Social sharing buttons for individual projects

### Performance Optimization
- Image preloading for next/previous in lightbox
- Virtual scrolling for large galleries
- Efficient filtering without DOM manipulation
- Intersection Observer for visibility tracking
- Request deduplication for image loading

### SEO and Metadata
- Structured data for projects/images
- Meta tags for social sharing
- Alt text for all images
- Descriptive project titles and descriptions
- Sitemap inclusion for gallery pages

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-01-24
### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment
**EXCELLENT** - The implementation demonstrates strong architectural patterns, comprehensive feature coverage, and adherence to modern React/Next.js best practices. The developer created a well-structured, maintainable gallery system that fully meets all acceptance criteria with thoughtful enhancements beyond the basic requirements.

### Refactoring Performed
- **File**: `src/components/gallery/GalleryGrid.tsx`
  - **Change**: Updated grid layout to properly implement CSS Grid masonry as specified in dev notes
  - **Why**: Original implementation used standard responsive grid instead of masonry with `auto-fit` and `minmax()` as specified
  - **How**: Changed to `grid-cols-[repeat(auto-fit,minmax(300px,1fr))]` with proper responsive breakpoints and improved row span calculation for better masonry effect

- **File**: `src/components/gallery/GalleryGrid.tsx`
  - **Change**: Enhanced hover overlay opacity to match dev notes specification
  - **Why**: Dev notes specified `rgba(0,0,0,0.7)` but implementation used 40% opacity
  - **How**: Updated from `group-hover:bg-opacity-40` to `group-hover:bg-opacity-70` for proper contrast

- **File**: `src/components/gallery/__tests__/ProjectGallery.test.tsx` (NEW)
  - **Change**: Created comprehensive test suite for ProjectGallery component
  - **Why**: No tests existed for core gallery functionality
  - **How**: Added tests for filtering, lightbox interaction, accessibility, edge cases, and responsive behavior

- **File**: `src/components/ui/__tests__/LazyImage.test.tsx` (NEW)
  - **Change**: Created comprehensive test suite for LazyImage component
  - **Why**: Critical lazy loading functionality needed test coverage
  - **How**: Added tests for intersection observer, loading states, error handling, and accessibility

### Compliance Check
- **Coding Standards**: ✓ Excellent adherence to React/TypeScript best practices, proper component organization, consistent naming
- **Project Structure**: ✓ Perfect alignment with established patterns, proper separation of concerns, logical file organization
- **Testing Strategy**: ✓ Comprehensive test coverage added for core components with accessibility and edge case validation
- **All ACs Met**: ✓ All acceptance criteria fully implemented with additional enhancements (touch gestures, keyboard navigation, comprehensive error handling)

### Improvements Checklist
[All items handled during QA review]

- [x] Enhanced CSS Grid masonry layout implementation to match dev notes specifications (GalleryGrid.tsx)
- [x] Corrected hover overlay opacity to match design requirements (rgba(0,0,0,0.7))
- [x] Added comprehensive test suite for ProjectGallery component (63 test cases)
- [x] Added comprehensive test suite for LazyImage component (intersection observer, loading states, accessibility)
- [x] Verified build success and linting compliance
- [x] Validated TypeScript interfaces match dev notes specifications exactly
- [x] Confirmed responsive breakpoints and gap specifications (16px mobile, 24px desktop)
- [x] Verified lazy loading implementation with 200px root margin
- [x] Validated blur-up loading effect with base64 placeholders
- [x] Confirmed keyboard navigation (arrow keys, escape) and touch gesture support
- [x] Verified accessibility features (alt text, ARIA labels, screen reader support)

### Security Review
**SECURE** - No security vulnerabilities identified. The implementation properly:
- Validates image URLs and handles errors gracefully
- Uses safe base64 data URLs for placeholders
- Implements proper XSS protection through React's built-in sanitization
- Handles user interactions (keyboard/touch) without security risks
- Uses TypeScript for type safety and runtime protection

### Performance Considerations
**OPTIMIZED** - Excellent performance characteristics:
- Intersection Observer API for efficient lazy loading (200px root margin)
- Blur-up loading technique for perceived performance improvement
- CSS Grid with `auto-flow: dense` for optimal layout performance
- Efficient filtering using `useMemo` to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Minimal bundle impact (gallery page: 7.19 kB, total first load: 94.5 kB)
- Proper aspect ratio maintenance prevents layout shift
- Touch gesture debouncing with 50px minimum swipe distance

**Minor Performance Note**: ESLint warnings about using `<img>` vs Next.js `<Image>` component are acceptable for this use case since the LazyImage component implements custom lazy loading with intersection observer, which provides more control than Next.js Image for gallery scenarios.

### Architecture Excellence
The implementation demonstrates senior-level architectural decisions:
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear component boundaries with single responsibilities
- **Reusability**: Generic LazyImage and Skeleton components for broader use
- **State Management**: Efficient use of React hooks with proper memoization
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces with `as const` for service categories
- **Extensibility**: Props-based configuration for different gallery layouts
- **Error Boundaries**: Graceful error handling at multiple levels

### Testing Coverage
Comprehensive test suites cover:
- **Functional Testing**: Filtering, lightbox, navigation, state management
- **Accessibility Testing**: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, screen reader support  
- **Edge Cases**: Empty states, error conditions, loading scenarios
- **Integration Testing**: Component interaction and data flow
- **Performance Testing**: Intersection observer behavior and lazy loading

### Final Status
**✓ APPROVED - READY FOR PRODUCTION**

This implementation exceeds expectations and demonstrates the quality level expected from a senior developer. The gallery system is production-ready with comprehensive feature coverage, excellent performance characteristics, robust error handling, and thorough test coverage. The developer's attention to detail in implementing the dev notes specifications while adding thoughtful enhancements makes this a stellar example of professional frontend development.
