## Acceptance Criteria
1. A new page is created at the `/services` route.
2. The page uses the standard site header and footer for consistency.

- Frontend Framework: Next.js ~14.1.0 (App Router)
- UI Components: Radix UI ~1.0.1
- Styling: Tailwind CSS ~3.4.1
- TypeScript: ~5.3.3

### V6 Design Consistency
[Source: Stories 5.1-5.5 implementations]

### Navigation and Routing
[Source: docs/architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
- Use Next.js App Router structure
- Page location: `/app/services/page.tsx`
- Dynamic routing: `/app/services/[slug]/page.tsx` (for Story 6.2)
- URL structure: `/services` and `/services/{service-slug}`

### Suggested Service Data Structure
```typescript
// src/data/services.ts
interface Service {
  id: string;
  slug: string;
  title: string;
  shortDescription: string;
  description: string;
  icon: string;
  image: string;
  features: string[];
  category: ServiceCategory;
  popular?: boolean;
}

// Example services
const services: Service[] = [
  {
    id: "1",
    slug: "roofing",
    title: "Roofing Services",
    shortDescription: "Complete roof installations, repairs, and maintenance",
    description: "Professional roofing services...",
    icon: "/images/icons/roofing.svg",
    image: "/images/services/roofing-hero.jpg",
    features: ["New Installations", "Repairs", "Maintenance"],
    category: "Roofing",
    popular: true
  },
  // ... other services
];
```

### Component Architecture
