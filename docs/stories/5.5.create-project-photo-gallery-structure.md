## Dev Notes

### Current Gallery System Context
[Source: apps/web/src/data/gallery.ts, apps/web/src/types/gallery.ts]

The project already has a complete gallery system:
- **ProjectImage Interface**: Defined with comprehensive metadata
- **Service Categories**: Roofing, Siding, Gutters, Windows, Chimneys, Commercial
- **Sample Data**: 8 existing project images with placeholder paths
- **Gallery Components**: Complete UI system for displaying projects

### Current Image References
[Source: apps/web/src/data/gallery.ts]

Existing images are referenced as:
- `/images/projects/roofing-modern-home-large.jpg`
- `/images/projects/siding-colonial-large.jpg`
- Thumbnail versions: `*-thumb.jpg`
- All images currently have placeholder paths

### Future Requirements Context
[Source: docs/prd-phase2/epic-6-core-page-creation.md]

Epic 6 will create individual service pages with image galleries:
- Service detail pages at `/services/[slug]`
- Each service page includes image gallery section
- Template designed for easy content addition
- Photos will be displayed by service category

### Recommended Folder Structure
```
public/images/gallery/
├── roofing/
│   ├── full/              # High-res images (1920x1280 max)
│   ├── thumbnails/        # Thumbnail versions (400x267)
│   └── before-after/      # Before/after transformation images
├── siding/
│   ├── full/
│   ├── thumbnails/
│   └── before-after/
├── gutters/
│   ├── full/
│   ├── thumbnails/
│   └── before-after/
├── windows/
│   ├── full/
│   ├── thumbnails/
│   └── before-after/
├── chimneys/
│   ├── full/
│   ├── thumbnails/
│   └── before-after/
├── commercial/
│   ├── full/
│   ├── thumbnails/
│   └── before-after/
└── README.md              # Quick reference for folder usage
```

### Image Naming Conventions
**Format**: `{service}-{project-type}-{location}-{date}`
**Examples**:
- `roofing-complete-replacement-westfield-2024-01-15.jpg`
- `siding-colonial-renovation-princeton-2023-12-08.jpg`
- `gutters-seamless-installation-summit-2024-01-22.jpg`

**Thumbnail naming**: Add `-thumb` suffix before extension
**Before/after**: Add `-before` or `-after` suffix

### Image Requirements and Standards
**Specifications**:
- **Full Images**: Max 1920x1280px, JPEG format, 85% quality
- **Thumbnails**: 400x267px, JPEG format, 80% quality
- **File Size**: Full images <800KB, thumbnails <100KB
- **Aspect Ratios**: Maintain 3:2 ratio for consistency
- **Format**: JPEG for photos, PNG for graphics with transparency

### Integration with Existing System
The gallery structure should integrate seamlessly with:
- Existing ProjectImage interface (no changes needed)
- Current gallery components (GalleryGrid, ProjectGallery, etc.)
- Service category filtering system
- Responsive image loading and optimization

### Performance Considerations
- Use Next.js Image component for optimization
- Implement lazy loading for gallery images
- Generate WebP versions for modern browsers
- Create blur data URLs for smooth loading transitions
- Consider CDN integration for production

### SEO and Accessibility
- Include descriptive alt text for all images
- Use semantic file names for better SEO
- Ensure proper image compression without quality loss
- Add structured data for image metadata
- Consider adding image captions and descriptions

### Development Workflow
**Adding New Photos**:
1. Place high-resolution image in appropriate `/full/` directory
2. Generate thumbnail using optimization script
3. Create blur data URL using utility script
4. Update `gallery.ts` with new ProjectImage entry
5. Validate all references using validation script

### Future Scalability
- Folder structure supports unlimited service categories
- Naming convention allows for project identification
- Before/after folders support transformation showcases
- Structure ready for potential CMS integration
- Supports future automation and batch processing

## Testing

### Testing Standards
[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Validation scripts to check file existence
- Automated testing for image loading
- Performance testing for gallery loading times
- Cross-browser testing for image display

### Key Test Scenarios
- All referenced images exist in correct folders
- Thumbnail generation produces correct sizes
- Gallery components load images from new structure
- Missing image fallbacks work correctly
- Image optimization maintains quality standards
- Folder structure supports all service categories
